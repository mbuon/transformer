# This example uses the pre-trained BERT model, which is a type of transformer model. 
# It tokenizes the input, converts tokens to their corresponding IDs, and then feeds this into the model to get
# the hidden states.This is a very basic usage of a transformer model in Python, 
# and it doesn't include many of the nuances and complexities of a full transformer model, like positional encoding, self-attention, layer normalization, etc. For a complete understanding and implementation of the transformer model, I'd recommend checking out the original paper ("Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., 2017) and the source code of the transformers library by Hugging Face.
# PSEUDO CODE OF THE TRANSFORMER
# Define Transformer model:
#  Initialize parameters
#
#  For each input in the input sequence:
#    Compute self-attention for the input
#    Add position encoding to the self-attention output
#    Apply feed-forward network to the above result
#  
#  For each output in the output sequence:
#    Compute masked self-attention for the output
#    Compute encoder-decoder attention with the output and the encoder result
#    Add position encoding to the encoder-decoder attention output
#    Apply feed-forward network to the above result
# 
#  Return the final output sequence



from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel

# Load pre-trained model tokenizer (vocabulary)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize input
text = "[CLS] Who was Jim Henson ? [SEP] Jim Henson was a puppeteer [SEP]"
tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

# Map the token strings to their vocabulary indeces
indexed_tokens = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenized_text)

# Convert inputs to PyTorch tensors
tokens_tensor = torch.tensor([indexed_tokens])

# Load pre-trained model (weights)
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Put the model in "evaluation" mode, meaning feed-forward operation
model.eval()

# Predict hidden states features for each layer
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(tokens_tensor)
    # Transformers models always output tuples.
    # See the models docstrings for the detail of all the outputs
    # In our case, the first element is the hidden state of the last layer of the Bert model
    encoded_layers = outputs[0]
